        <p>
            &emsp; &emsp; I grew up in the small town of <a href="Hometown-FrontEnd/neighborhood copy.html">Goodrich, Michigan </a>outside of Flint. 
            My neighbor introduced me to the high school robotics team in the summer of 2010 and I loved that it was a mini business. The product was a robot that had to play a different game every year and the atmosphere at competitions was like a sporting event. I got to do a little of everything; work with power tools, work on the team's website, drive the robot at competitions, and helped the team win awards like Imagery, Automation in Control, & The Judge's award by talking to judges. <br><br>  &emsp; &emsp;
            
            <p> I felt a lack of support as I explored these skills from the adults that were supposed to be my support network. After high school I went to Full Sail University and earned a Bachelor's Degree in Music Business. I continued to stay involved in FIRST Robotics as a business team mentor for Exploding Bacon #1902. More about that <a href="FIRST.html">here.</a> The experience working with FIRST Robotics teams led me to becoming the manager of <a href="https://www.therobotgarage.com/"> The Robot Garage</a> in Birmingham, MI. Then the pandemic hit and their physical location was closed for multiple years. In that time I started delivering groceries through Shipt and later Instacart to pay the bills. I also had a lot of free time to explore other skills including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC89Jctn71sdlyd6MWU_dF5w"> video editing</a> and <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/ashleykosik/original-designs/"> graphic design.</a> <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;
            The year 2023 I decided to start learning front end development with a free trial of LinkedIn Learning and came across Hackbright's Bright Path Full Stack Development Bootcamp sponsored by Perficient. I created my first full stack application - <a href="Whimify/Whimify-App copy/client/index.html"> Whimify.</a> I am currently finishing the Bright Path program with a specialization in Java.
