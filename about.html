    <h1>About Ashley</h1>

    <p>
        Growing up in the 2000s neopets.com was all the rage and it was there that I first coated HTML pages. In high school a friend convinced me to join the first robotics team. I thought it was so cool that it was like a mini business and we got to be hands on with power tools and build robots that competed in sports. I received a lot of backlash from the adults in my life. Even the wife of the head mentor of the team said you know you are going to have to get your hands dirty when I invited a group of girls to join the team with me. That and the career advice from my father was you have to go to college but don’t end up in front of a computer all. So I moved to Orlando Florida for a degree in entertainment business at Full Sail University hoping to work for a record label. I mentored an awesome FIRST robotics team - exploding bacon and spent some time working at Universal Studios to pay rent as I tried out a few internships that lead no where. Stressed from the high cost of rent and no support system I returned to Michigan and was hired at The Robot Garage because of my background with FIRST robotics. It was a great experience moving into my first management role but then the pandemic shut it down for several years.(I even managed to buy a house on a $12 an hour salary in 2017) I picked up grocery delivery through the Shipt app and made way better money working half the hours I used to. Unfortunately the stability in that job didn’t last either. I tried adding Instacart to my income. Trying to work through the pandemic I developed an anxiety disorder. I suffered through 2 depressive episodes. I spend 6 months looking for full time work before deciding to try a coding bootcamp. Linked in trial. Bright Paths program. I think tech consulting would be perfect for my early career. I’m proud of what I have accomplished and overcome to be where I am starting a new career. I don’t have to try to be who I think the world wants me to be. Part of the speed of the society we live in now is daring to try to be someone you never thought you could be.
